    <h2 style="margin-bottom:0.75em"><b>Notes regarding the Clowder Project</b></h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom:1em"><b>Large Diagrams and the Zoom In Feature. </b>This work features many diagrams that are un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;na&shy;te&shy;ly too large to be comfortably legible in their native size. To com&shy;pen&shy;sa&shy;te for this, it's possible to click on them to expand their size by 200%, or al&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;ti&shy;ve&shy;ly open them as separate images in new tabs by right-clicking and then se&shy;lec&shy;ting “Open image in new tab”.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom:1em"><b>A Note on Style. </b>There are a few uncommon stylistic choices made through&shy;out these notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Every proposition, theorem, lemma, etc. needs to come with a proof, even if the lat&shy;ter simply reads “Omitted.”. This is to en&shy;sure re&shy;sul&shy;ts without proof are clearly la&shy;be&shy;led as su&shy;ch.</li>
      <li>Every proof must read either “Omitted” or be properly justified, no matter how tri&shy;vial the details are. Expressions like “it is clear”, “it is straighforward to show that”, “it is obvious”, etc. inside proofs are forbidden.</li>
      <li>This project should work also as a wiki so there's a considerably larger amount of re&shy;pe&shy;ti&shy;ti&shy;on than is usual in a math text, as well as non-linearity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="margin-bottom:1em"><b>Preferences. </b>You can change the font of the site, the style of the PDFs, as well as turn on dark mode by clicking the gear button at the top of the page.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom:1em"><b>PDF Styles. </b>The PDFs for each chapter as well as for the whole book are generated using four di&shy;ffe&shy;rent styles, as summarised in the following table:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Style</th>
        <th>Class</th>
        <th>Font</th>
        <th>Theorem Environments</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topological-modular-forms/clowder-project-output/master/tags-book/alegreya-sans-tcb.pdf">Style 1</a></td>
        <td><code>book</code></td>
        <td>Alegreya Sans</td>

        <td>Arno*</td>
        <td><code>amsthm</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

    <p style="margin-top:0.5em;text-align:left;margin-bottom:1em">*To be replaced with Linus Romer's <a href="https://typedrawers.com/discussion/2630/elemaints-a-serif-family-with-optical-sizes">Elemaints</a> when it is released.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em"><b>Placeholder Symbols and Future Style. </b>Currently, a number of macros have been de&shy;fi&shy;ned using pla&shy;ce&shy;hol&shy;der symbols, and look very ugly as a re&shy;sult.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom:1em">This is because we eventually plan to replace them with (the math font for) Darwin, a free and open-source typeface project currently being worked on, and which will eventually allow us more freedom in wri&shy;ting these notes:</p>

    <span class="dark-svg"><img width="100%" src="/static/images/darwin.svg"></span>

    <p style="margin-bottom:1em">You can find more details about Darwin at its <a href="https://github.com/topological-modular-forms/Darwin-Typeface">Git&shy;Hub repository</a> or <a href="https://darwintypeface.com">website</a>.</p>
